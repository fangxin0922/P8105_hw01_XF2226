```

    ## [1] -0.4087875

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_tibble, vec_logical)) #mean works because for a logical vector, TRUE is considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0.
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_tibble, vec_character)) #mean does NOT work because this is a character vector
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_tibble, vec_character)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_tibble, vec_factor)) #mean does NOT work because this is a factor vector with levels
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_tibble, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_logical)) #as.numeric works because for a logical vector, TRUE is considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0. The logical vector can be created as type numeric. This explains why the mean function works. 

as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_character)) #NAs introduced, because this a character vector, which cannot be coerced into type numeric. This explains why the mean function did not work. 
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_factor)) #The output tells us that in this factor vector, "a" is level 1, "b" is level 2, "c" is level 3. This factor vector can be coerced into type numeric. This does not explain why the mean function did not work. However, we know that the mean function does not work because this is still a factor vector with 3 levels of "a", "b", and "c" and we cannot take the mean of a factor vector like this.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

-   The names of important variables in the penguins dataset are
    species, island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm,
    flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year.
-   The number of rows is 344 and the number of columns is 8.
-   The mean of the flipper length variable is NA.

``` r
scatterplot_flipper_bill <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
