``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_logical)) #as.numeric works because for a logical vector, TRUE is considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0. The logical vector can be created as type numeric. This explains why the mean function works. 

as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_character)) #NAs introduced, because this a character vector, which cannot be coerced into type numeric. This explains why the mean function did not work. 
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_factor)) #The output tells us that in this factor vector, "a" is level 1, "b" is level 2, "c" is level 3. This factor vector can be coerced into type numeric. This does not explain why the mean function did not work. However, we know that the mean function does not work because this is still a factor vector with 3 levels of "a", "b", and "c" and we cannot take the mean of a factor vector like this.

``` r

```

-   The names of variables in the penguins dataset are species, island,
    bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
    body\_mass\_g, sex, year
-   The mean for penguins bill length is 43.9219298 mm, and the median
    is 44.45 mm.
-   The mean penguins body mass is 4201.754386 g, and the median body
    mass is 4050 g.
-   The number of rows is 344 and the number of columns is 8.
-   The mean of the flipper length variable is 200.9152047 mm.

``` r
scatterplot_flipper_bill <- ggplot2::ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
