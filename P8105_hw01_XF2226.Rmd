)

```

```{r problem1 - Test if mean of each variable in problem1_tibble works}

mean(pull(problem1_tibble,random_sample)) #mean works because this is a numeric vector

mean(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_logical)) #mean works because for a logical vector, TRUE is considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0.

mean(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_character)) #mean does NOT work because this is a character vector

mean(pull(problem1_tibble,vec_factor)) #mean does NOT work because this is a factor vector with levels
